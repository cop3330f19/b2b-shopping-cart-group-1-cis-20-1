Due Thursday February 27, 2020 by 12:30pm

Each group member needs to join the GitHub group and push code to the git. If your user does not have any commits then you have not contributed to the project.

Objective

Your company is a major clothing manufacturer who sells to most major department and clothing stores throughout the US. Because of the size of your business, you extend a line of credit to all your customers. When a customer places an order, one of your associates enters their names (the associate) into the system and then looks up the customer, and enters the selected items and quantities. The system should only allow the associate to create orders for existing customers, and only allow items to be added as long as they have not surpassed the maximum on their remaining line of credit.

Customer Class

You are provided a pipe delimited customer file, customer.dat. This file contains the following information:

Customer Number Customer Name Line of Credit Address

This information should be read for the text file and loaded into a objects of class Customer, which is defined as follows:

string customerNum;
string customerName;
double lineOfCredit;
Address * corperateAddress;
This class should include a constructor that accepts 2 strings and a double variables and a no-argument constructor.

Note that the last data member of the class is a pointer to an Address object.

Address Class

Address is another class. You should create a vector of addresses as you read in the file. You should only create a new address element if it is not already in the vector. If the address is already in the vector then the pointer should use the address of that element. The Address data members are as follows:

string streetAddress;
string city;
string state; 
string zipCode;
This class should include a constructor that accepts all the member variables and a no-argument constructor.

Note that each time you add an element to the vector the address of the vector changes. You will need to record the addresses after adding all addresses to the vector.

Product Class

A list of items is provided in the inventory.dat file. This file contains:

Item Number Item Description Unit Price Quantity in Stock

The inventory items should also be loaded into Product objects as described below:

int itemNo;
string description;
double price;
int stockQuantity
This class should include a constructor that accepts all the member variables and a no-argument constructor.

Complete set and get functions for each data member in each class. Each class should also have a print function. The print function should print the object to match the output required by the driver. In the Address class this function should be called getAddress and return a string.

Driver

As the associate enters the items (using the item number) and quantities, the system should verify that you the customer still has available credit and the stock has not be depleted. The system should also verify that the associate is entering accurate information. Once completed, the system will display a final order summary and update the stock of the items sold. The order summary should also be written to a file (the filename should be the order number). Below is a sample output.

b2b

Use the following function to generate the order number.

#include #include

string generateOrderNum(){ time_t now = time(0);

string oNum;

stringstream strstream;

strstream << now;

strstream >> oNum;

return oNum;
}

Remember to compile your program use the g++ command and list all CPP files. Use the following functions in StringHelper.h as needed. To use this class, when compiling add StringHelper.o to the list of files.

Documentation Requirements:

The documentation must include the follow:

Cover Page (provided; fill in all information; each page should have the same header/footer) Table of Contents Project Rubric (last pages of document) Pseudocode Flowchart (1 per function) Class Diagrams Description of the major inputs, outputs, and processes. The code: Well commented code (follow function comments in the code provided, StringHelper.h) The top of each file should include: Name of the file Group number and member names Date last edited Purpose of the program Cover page and project rubric can be found in Blackboard as part of the assignment.
